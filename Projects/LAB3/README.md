## Sections Implemented
- Hero/Introduction with name, greeting, and short bio about being a 1st year CSE student at KR Mangalam University.
- About section describing interests in simple, user-friendly web design and learning goals.
- Skills section summarizing technical and personal strengths.
- Projects section listing mini‑projects like a student result calculator, calorie tracker, and a simple landing page with brief descriptions.
- Contact section with a short message and email address for reaching out.
- Navigation bar linking to sections, plus responsive layout for different screen sizes.

## Breakpoints & Layout Techniques
- Uses semantic HTML5 structure with sections for Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- Layout built mainly with Flexbox and responsive containers to center and align content.
- Media queries included in `style.css` to adjust font sizes, spacing, and stacking of sections on smaller screens (common mobile breakpoint around 768px).

## How to Open Locally
1. Place `portfolio.html`, `style.css`, and `Profile_pic.jpg` in the same folder.
2. Double‑click `portfolio.html` or open it via any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. Ensure the filename references for the CSS and image inside the HTML match the actual file names so styles and the profile picture load correctly.
