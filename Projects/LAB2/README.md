Key Additions and Improvements

1. Styling with CSS: A <style> block has been added, providing custom colors, improved fonts, and alignment.
   This includes background colors for main sections, stylized navigation, a circular and centered profile image, max-width for main content, and table presentation improvements.
2. Image Presentation: The profile image now appears centered and circular using border-radius:50% and the .center class, making the layout more visually appealing.
3. Form Button Styling: Submit and reset buttons are now styled with background and text colors, offering a more attractive and noticeable appearance.
4. Overall Layout: All content is more consistently aligned, visually separated, and easier to navigate through the use of CSS, with additional margin/padding for main and section elements.
5. Table and Section Headings: Better use of headings and visual separation of technical and non-technical skills.
6. Minor Adjustments: Main content now sits within a constrained width and is centered, improving the reading experience, while most section titles are more consistent and color-themed.
